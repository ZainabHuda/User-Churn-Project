The Waze user churn project focused on developing a machine learning model to predict whether a user would continue using the app or stop (“churn”).
By analyzing historical user data and applying tree-based classification algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, the team aimed to identify at-risk users, allowing Waze to take targeted actions to improve retention and overall business outcomes.
